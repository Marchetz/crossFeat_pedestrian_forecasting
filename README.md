# crossFeat_pedestrian_forecasting
Official Pytorch code for the paper "CrossFeat: Semantic Cross-modal Attention for Pedestrian Behavior Forecasting" (t-IV).

#in train.py, set configuration for Comet,  set api_key, project_name and workspace


## Installation
0. To install the required packages, create a conda environment using this command: 
```bash
conda create -n <name_env> python=3.7
```

1. Pytorch installation:
Then you can install PyTorch 1.9.1 choosing your cude version (this code has been tried with cuda 11):
```bash
pip install torch==1.9.1+cu111 torchvision==0.10.1+cu111 torchaudio==0.9.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

2. Install the following libraries: scikit-learn, tqdm, pandas, comet, matplotlib, opencv

## Dataset Preparation
0. The project uses the TRANS benchmark, please follow the instruction in <a id='google TRANS'>[TRANS preparation](https://github.com/vita-epfl/pedestrian-transition-dataset)</a>. .

1. Then, download the semantic segmentation generated by Mask2Former from this link <a id='google drive'>[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mpXyRNov-Cw56Ewb5yHMu6Q4BPcY275a?usp=sharing)</a>.
Put the semantic segmentation images in the same folder where are the rgb images.

## Train the Model
To train a model, utilize the script train.py

For example, use this command:
```bash
python train.py
```

## Test the Model
In a pretrained folder, there are the pretrained weights of the models.

To test the model, use this command:
```bash
python eval.py
```
